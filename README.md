# feedback-form
This is a Student Feedback Form designed to collect students' opinions on course content and teaching quality. It includes fields for personal details (name, roll number, email, etc.) and a set of multiple-choice questions rating aspects of the teacherâ€™s performance. The form uses HTML5 for structure and validation, and CSS for a clean, colorful design.
